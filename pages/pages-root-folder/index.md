<h1>Seminar Series April 2024</h1>

+ **Dates/Times:** Fridays, April 5th, 2024 - April 26th, 2024, 10:30AM-11:45AM EST
+ **Location:** The series will be hybrid, with in-person sessions held in Philip Austin Bldg Room 313 at UConn Storrs, CT and all sessions broadcast live via Webex.

This series is organized by Shane J Sacco and Kun Chen of the Department of Statistics at UConn. We aim to 

+ discuss emerging biostatistics and data science methods to address health-related topics;
+ provide a platform to connect statisticians, data scientists, and researchers in the State of Connecticut and beyond that work on health-related topics. 

More than ever biostatistics and data science techniques are being leveraged to help prevent and intervene with health conditions and diseases as well as to improve mental and physical health. In this seminar series, we present recent advancements in biostatistics and data science applying to a wide range of health topics, including but not limited to heart disease, suicide, and COVID.

<p>
  Dr. Shane J Sacco is a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Statistics at the University of Connecticut and a member at the Center for Population Health at the University of Connecticut Health Center. He received his PhD in Health Promotion Science at the University of Connecticut, with his dissertation focusing upon applied methods to improve nonlinear interaction testing in the social sciences. His current research aims to improve suicide risk prediction using transfer-learning techniques, clinical decision-making pipelines, and feature and outcome engineering.

<h4>Abstract</h4>

Predicting health outcomes utilizing statistical models is becoming a more commonplace notion in healthcare. However, all statistical models contain some degree of uncertainty in prediction. Many current modelling approaches involve creating thresholds to transform model outputs into binary decisions regarding risk (i.e., 1=high risk; 0=not high risk). These model outputs are typically point estimates of risk from the model and do account for uncertainty (or the possible error) behind this estimate. So, when a patient is declared high risk for a condition or event, are they really high risk? This presentation discusses sources of uncertainty in predictive models and possible methods to account for uncertainty. Two case studies are provided in context of major adverse cardiac events and suicide attempts.

<p>

Dr. Jung Wun Lee attained his Ph.D. in the Department of Statistics at the University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, U.S. He is currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Department of Statistics at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. His research topics include finite mixture models, incomplete data analysis, novelty detection, and Bayesian inferences. His current research agenda focuses on how to deal with complex missing data problems in electronic health records.

<h4>Abstract</h4>

This paper establishes a series of sensitivity analyses to investigate the impact of missing values in the electronic health records (EHR) that are possibly missing not at random (MNAR). EHRs have gained tremendous interest due to their cost-effectiveness, but their employment for research involves numerous challenges, such as selection bias due to missing data. The blended analysis has been suggested to overcome such challenges, which decomposes the data provenance into a sequence of sub-mechanisms and uses a combination of inverse-probability weighting (IPW) and multiple imputation (MI) under missing at random assumption (MAR). In this paper, we expand the blended analysis under the MNAR assumption and present a sensitivity analysis framework to investigate the effect of MNAR missing values on the analysis results. We illustrate the performance of my proposed framework via numerical studies and conclude with strategies for interpreting the results of sensitivity analyses. In addition, we present an application of our framework to the DURABLE data set, an EHR from an NIH-funded study examining long-term outcomes of patients who underwent bariatric surgery.
