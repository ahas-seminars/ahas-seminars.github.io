This annual event is organized by the [Connecticut Chapter of the American Statistical Association](https://community.amstat.org/connecticutchapter/home) (ASA-CT). We aim to 

+ engage our current and prospective ASA members;
+ discuss emerging topics in statistics and data science;
+ provide a platform to connect statisticians and data scientists in the State of Connecticut and beyond and to promote statistics and data science to the next generation. 

We are in the era of Artificial Intelligence. Every day we are witnessing the fast growth of AI and ML in every aspect of our lives and experiencing the changes that AI and ML are making to our life, work, study and the way of thinking. Unavoidably AI and ML are also changing the way we develop new drugs and how we conduct clinical research. Can AI and ML make drug development more efficient in terms of time and costs? How can we harness AI to identify new drug targets faster and more accurately? Will the conventional way we conduct clinical trials be fundamentally changed by AI and ML and how? At the ASA CT Chapter 2024 Annual Mini Conference, we have invited researchers pioneering in the applications of AI and ML in drug development to talk about the new methodologies and novel applications of AI and ML in drug discovery and development. They will share their experience and thoughts from different perspectives including biopharma industry, health technology, regulatory agencies and academic research institute. We hope this forum can facilitate knowledge exchange among different disciplines, as well as sparkle new research topics and nourish broader collaborations of AI/ML throughout drug development lifecycle.
